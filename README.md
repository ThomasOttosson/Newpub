# The Anderson Club

This project is a fantasy based project which provides value as a professional website framework
for clubs, bars, pubs, organizations etc. The website gives a simple readable & responsive data structure framework that can be adjusted which solves issues amongst the companies in the mentioned industries where i've seen a lack of quality in terms of visual experience and responsiveness.

The deployed website version can be found on this url adress: https://thomasottosson.github.io/Newpub/index.html

* The colors and font style in the header is inspired by Mafia themes since they were a society back in the days who enjoyed clubs.

## Section of benefits

* Each text line also contains a hr element to make the text look more fulfilling and dyslectic friendly.

## The About Page

* The about page tells a story about an invented fantasy character called Mr Allen Andersson where you can see an image of that fantasy person.

* I have also included a link in the about page to wikipedia.org where i pretended that people can read more about this person in order to show more of my abilities.

## Pictures

* The pictures page will provide the user a good understanding how the club looks and what's available in terms of quality.

* Since membership for this club is expensive, it's very value for the user to see online what their money would go towards.

## Apply Membership Form

* In this form i kept it as simple as posible since i like clean designs. In the form you can find inputs where a user needs to fill in their: First Name, Last Name, Email Adress, Job Title and radio buttons were the user need to choose an option if they want a private parking.

* On the h2 element you can find a font awsome icon which i feel matches the purpose of the form.

* On the bottom of the form you can find a submit button which i gave a border radius property in the css file for the purpose to showcase my abilities a little bit more but i feel that a submit button with sharp edges would probably look better.

## Features left to improve the website

* Add a description to each image on the pictures page.

* Add a background image to membership page.

* Add a hover function to the social media buttons.

* Adjust the logo and navigation so the logo becomes a little larger.

* Add a shop to the club so any users can buy merch or tickets for the seminar.
